# VanillaJS JSX

This is an simple example project using JSX with VanillaJS. It uses Babel to transpile the single `main.jsx` file in the `src` folder.
I didn't want to add a packager like Webpack or anything to keep things simple.

## Prerequisite

You need to install the npm packages before building the project:
```sh
npm install
```

## How to build

To build the project, you can simply do:
```sh
npm run build
```

To build-watch the project:
```sh
npm run watch
```

You can then open the `index.html` file to see the result.
